This program is designed to find all duplicate files in the current
directory.  It first checks for duplicate file sizes.  If it finds any,
the program then checks those duplicates with md5 hashes.  If any md5
hashes are duplicated, the program prompts the user to delete one or
more files, move one or more files, or skip.

This is an exercise in learning C.
